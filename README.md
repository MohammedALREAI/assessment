- about  this "When update project name of a favorited project, the project name in "Favorite Projects" shall be updated as well. It is expected to be 
implemented with a elegant solution"


- here what i understand you need see reflective data after update  the  project so i dont know  id  that  what you need or not.



- i not try to used any other library for state management just use use context and reducer that build in react for just make code simple and not use any external library just  to used powerfull of react.
